# Moxa image resize utility

Moxa image resize utility is used to shrink the dumped image file size.

## Usage

```
# ./resize-img <image_type> <image_file>
```

---

## Steps to create a customized Image

Here we take UC-8100 as illustration:

#### 1. Install and modify all the applications and configurations you want on the UC-8100

#### 2. Dump the image by `dd` command. There are two methods to copy the whole system

- 2.a - Dump via ethernet and save it to another Linux PC with enough storage
	```
	# dd if=<device> | ssh <Username of Linux PC>@<IP address of Linux PC> dd of=<dumped_image_file>
	```
	
	The device can be checked by `lsblk` command:
	
	![lsblk](/lsblk.PNG)
	
	In this example, root is mounted at "/dev/mmcblk0p2", so the device is "/dev/mmcblk0":
	
	```
	# dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | ssh user@192.168.3.100 dd of=/tmp/uc8100_dump.img
	```

- 2.b Dump the image to the local storage such as USB disk
	```
	# dd if=<device> of=<dumped_image_file>
	```
	
	![lsblk-usb](/lsblk_usb.PNG)
	
	In this example, root is mounted at "/dev/mmcblk2p2", so the device is "/dev/mmcblk2":
	
	```
	# dd if=/dev/mmcblk2 of=/media/usb/uc8100_dump.img
	```

#### 3. Clone or download this repository on your Linux PC
```
# git clone https://github.com/Moxa-Linux/resize-image
# cd resize-image
```

#### 4. Resize the image

The image type can be found at "Image type table" below (The image type of "UC-8100" is type A)

```
# ./resize-img A /tmp/uc8100_dump.img
```

The output image file will be named as "resize.img"
